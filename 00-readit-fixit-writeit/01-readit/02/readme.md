## Look at the 'Template literals' documentation

Template literals are literals delimted with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged template.

Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.

Syntax :

`string text`

`string text line 1
 string text line 2`

`string text ${expression} string text`

tagFunction`string text ${expression} string text`
