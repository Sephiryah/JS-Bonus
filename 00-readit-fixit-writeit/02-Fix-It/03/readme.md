# Exercice 03

## Why are we not seeing any tv shows? Look at the error message in the dev tools and solve it.

The tvshows variable has been replaced by a 'movie' variable who don't exist in the for loop. We have to replace it with tvshows variable.

## Try to display the list on the screen in reversed order. (without adjusting the original array)

I created a new variable tvshowsReversed to clone the tvshows array, then I used the reverse() function on tvshowsReversed and I replaced tvshows by tvshowsReversed in the for loop
