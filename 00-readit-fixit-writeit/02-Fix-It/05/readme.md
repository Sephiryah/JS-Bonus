# Exercice 05

## Look at the error message in the dev tools and fix it.

Fix: Replaced const words with let words

## Look at the documentation of split().

The split() method takes a pattern and divides a String into an ordered list of substrings by searching for the pattern, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.

## Look at the documentation of charAt().

The charAt() method will return the character of a string positioned at the index given by the parameters.

## Look at the documentation of slice().

The slice() method will return a copy of the given array with all the element outside of the start and end element (end element included) removed.

## Adjust the function to get the desired result

Fix : 
    - Added ', ' in the parameter of sentence.split();
    - Added '1' in the parameter of words.slice();
